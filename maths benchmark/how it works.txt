Hello!
I'm glad that you have downloaded maths benchmark!

how it works:
let's take 1 as n
now we add n with n again
which makes n now 2
this pattern is executed for the number of times you have typed in the beggining of the program.
the time taken is given too at the end.

Note: it may take a while as you are making you're computer a lot of numeber crunching.
